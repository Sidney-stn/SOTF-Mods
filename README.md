## LogSledAutoPickup
### Features:
- Automatically picks up logs or stones when you walk over them with any of the logsleds.
- Works in singleplayer and multiplayer.
- Super handy for when you're building a big base and need to move a lot of logs or stones.

### How to use:
- When using any of the logsleds, a small `UI` will appear in the bottom right corner of the screen.
- This `UI` will show what will be picked up when you walk over a log or stone.
- It cycles between `LOGS`, `STONES` and `NONE` when pressing `C` *(DEFAULT KEY) Changable in Mod Settings*
- Just walk over logs or stones with any of the logsleds and the selected item will be picked up automatically.
